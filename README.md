the third project from my goals list
this is a very basic todo app with add/update and delete features
the app fits the declared features but it isn't complete due to deadline problems, 
what did i learn new from it?
no thing is perfect
accidentelly crossed with the mvi, it is kind of magic
learned few about animations and transitions
used room database
navigation with compose and new views as date picker and time picker
dealing with dates (LocalDate, LocalTime, ZonedDateTime, Instance...)
